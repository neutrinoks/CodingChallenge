# Coding Challenge Compression Tool (cccompress)

Coding challenge by John Cricket, [description](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman/).

After studying the Huffman tree decoding mechanism, an own implementation, which wasn't that nice - I replaced that implementation by the `huffman-coding` crate, which is a really nice and clean implementation. You can check the code at docs.rs of [this crate](https://docs.rs/huffman-coding/latest/huffman_coding/).

Simple functional implementation in a library crate, used within a executable binary as command line tool.
